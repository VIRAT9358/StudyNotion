## Technical Details

In the subsequent sections, we'll delve into the technical aspects that power StudyNotion, encompassing the system architecture, front-end and back-end development, API design, deployment strategies, and future enhancements.

## System Architecture

The StudyNotion platform is structured around three core components: the front end, the back end, and the database. Employing a client-server model, the front end serves as the user interface, while the back end and database operate as the server.

### Front-end

Leveraging ReactJS, a dynamic JavaScript library, StudyNotion crafts responsive user interfaces crucial for engaging learning experiences. RESTful API calls facilitate seamless communication between the front end and back end.

### Back-end

StudyNotion's back end harnesses the power of NodeJS and ExpressJS, ensuring a robust foundation for scalable server-side applications. APIs are provided for functionalities such as user authentication, course management, and content handling.

### Database

MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database, forms the backbone of StudyNotion's data storage. Its adaptability accommodates unstructured and semi-structured course content, user data, and platform-related information.
